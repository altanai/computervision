# Text Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract and OpenCV

- To read road signs and boards 
- Read the text of garbage to underdtand what kind of garbage it is (recyclable/ non recyclable)

To recognize an image with a single character a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used . 
Text of arbitrary length/sequence of characters uses Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs). LSTM is a popular form of RNN.

## Requirnments  

Tesseract library (libtesseract)
Command line Tesseract tool (tesseract-ocr)
Python wrapper for tesseract (pytesseract)

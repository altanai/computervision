# Computer vision libs and techniques for Ramudroid 

## Raspberry Pi camera module 

Raspberry Pi Camera find applications in areas from robotics to home automation.
applications provided: raspistill, raspivid, raspiyuv and raspividyuv

### Deep Learning 

Googleâ€™s TensorFlow is a python library for Deep Learning. 
It can be used for image recognition, face detection, natural language processing etc
2 methods to install TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi:
- TensorFlow for CPU
- TensorFlow for Edge TPU Co-Processor

Install deep-learning libraries tensorflow and keras 
```
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install keras
```
### OpenCV

Opencv (cv2 lib in python ) is used for computer vision , it captures and trabsforms the pictures.
numpy and matplotlib are use for image pre-processing and rendering along with it

```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev -y && sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev -y && sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev -y && sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev -y && sudo apt-get install libqtgui4 -y && sudo apt-get install libqt4-test -y
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install matplotlib
```

```

## Run 
To detect an object and draw box to identify it  
```
python3 detect.py
```
sample results in outputs folder 


### 3x3 grid , image detection on centre box 

dividing image into 3x3 grid 

![centre_grid_box](imgs/centre_grid_box.jpg)

sample 
![centre_grid_box](imgs/3_processed.jpeg)

perform image detection on box-5

### 3x2 grid , edge detection on bottom centre box 

dividing image into 3x2 grid

## Canny Edge Detection

Perform edge detection on box-5

Initial edge detection using canny edge method doesnt give satisfactory result in evaluating edges
